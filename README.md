# About the Course Materials
These HCI 330 course materials are based on the work of Mike Horn, Nell O'Rourke, and others. HCI 330 is a 10-week undergraduate course in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University that introduces some principles for designing and analyzing interactive, user-facing computer systems. Topics include user-centered design, prototyping and evaluation techniques, accessibility, and graphical design fundamentals. The course also reviews emerging areas of HCI research. 

As students learn these principles, they also work in teams to design and evaluate a web app, using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Experimental Materials & Lessons (Winter 2020)
This quarter, I had a few experimental learning goals for students -- some relating to the design and analysis of human-computer systems, and some relating to practical/technical skill development. These two sets of learning goals came out of challenges I encountered while teaching the course previously (Winter, 2019), as elaborated below. I didn't formally evaluate any of these lessons, but I did [write a memo](https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/reflections/) to reflect on the experience and to share various student perspectives.
