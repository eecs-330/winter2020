# Intentions and Reflections
These course materials are based on the work of Mike Horn, Nell O'Rourke, and others, and intended to create a 10-week, project-based learning experience for undergraduate students who are interested in 

## Goals
I had a few experimental goals for the course this time 'round, which came out of some challenges I encountered previously teaching the course.

### Critical / Analytic / Reflective
On the critical/analytic side...
1. A recognition that technologies shape individual behavior AND larger social systems, and that it’s important to examine these shifts and their impact on different groups of people. Supports for this included:
   * Lecture 2: https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/02lecture
   * HW3: https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/assignments/hw3 (I allowed students to resubmit if they really missed the mark)
2. That we all have many unexamined beliefs and assumptions (about how the world works and how technology can/does function in the world), and it's important to name those assumptions and to treat them as a question (versus as a given).
   * https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/04lecture (tried to deconstruct some of students’ project proposals and pull out the assumptions about the problem space).
   * In studio: research prep + worksheet (I think this worked pretty well in the 2 studios I observed): https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/09lab
3. A design process literacy<br>I wanted them to spend some time reflecting on the process of devising an app, and the rationale behind their design choices and iterations.
