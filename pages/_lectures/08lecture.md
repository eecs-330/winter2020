### Overview
Today, we're going to do continue our journey through what to build and how to build it...
1. What to build?<br>We went over interviews last Wednesday. Today we will be talking about contextual inquiry.
2. How to build it?<br>We're moving from HTML, CSS, and the DOM, to dynamic DOM manipulation with Javascript (ES6). Please review the Lynda.com videos for more ES6 reference materials.
