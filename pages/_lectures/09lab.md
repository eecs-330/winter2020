    Analyzing your own thinking and developing a research plan.
---

Today in lab, you will be doing two things:
1. Preparing for your field research
2. Reviewing some HTML / CSS techniques relevant to HW4

### 1. Field Research Planning
1. Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Q6NXLbeH43J9isxMBfRlMfLST5JI5FpKTSFhKelaOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this worksheet</a>.
2. When you're done, your group will share out their research protocol / strategy to the rest of the studio.
3. This will also give your peers and your studio lead the opportunity to give you feedback on your plan.

### 2. HW4
If there is time, feel free to ask your studio lead about HTML and CSS. 

Also, please also refer to the Lynda.com tutorials (<a href="05lecture">assigned on 1/15</a>).
