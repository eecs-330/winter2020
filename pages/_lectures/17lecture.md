We'll be talking about the design principles discussed in the second chapter of Norman's book in lecture today:
1. Conceptual Models
2. Natural Mappings
3. Constraints
4. Consistency

In Chapter 2 of The Design of Everyday Things, Norman talks about how users often falsely blame themselves for bad designs. How could this be a problem for you as you test your initial designs of your team project?
