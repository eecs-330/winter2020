We'll be talking about the rest of the Norman design principles from Chapter 1:
1. Conceptual Models
2. Natural Mappings
3. Constraints
4. Consistency

In Chapter 2 of The Design of Everyday Things, Norman talks about how users often falsely blame themselves for bad designs. How could this be a problem for you as you test your initial designs of your team project?

Note: if we have time for JavaScript, we'll be working with the same [sample files](../course-files/lectures/lecture10.zip) as we did on Monday.
