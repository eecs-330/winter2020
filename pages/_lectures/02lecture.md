Each generation of technologies is accompanied by both utopian and dystopian visions. These perspectives are worth considering as you develop your own perspectives on the relationship between technology and humanity:
* Will the Internet, Big Data, AI, IoT, ubiquitous computing, etc. save us all?
* How should we be think about what computing applications can and cannot accomplish? 
* In what ways does computing make the world better? 
* In what ways does it make it worse?

To think about such things, please read a "classic" HCI text: **Do Artifacts Have Politics?**. You will be drawing on this article, the Morozov interview, and others for your second homework assignment.
