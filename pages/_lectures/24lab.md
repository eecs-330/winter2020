    Studio to be used for testing your prototype

Just like last week, we will be doing user testing in section. Please do the following:

### A. Prepare for testing before coming to studio
You should prepare to test your computer prototype in studio. You will be reporting your findings from user testing in P7. In particular, you should:

1. Prepare a briefing for test users about the purpose of your app and any background information that may be needed. It should not describe how to use the interface.
2. Write your task on an index card. Just write the concrete goals of the task (e.g. "buy milk, tomatoes, and bread"). Don't write the specific steps to follow, since that's for your users to figure out. 
3. Choose roles for your team members. One person can support the user by giving the providing the briefing and the task index card. The other team members are observers. It may be useful for you to swap roles, so that each of you gets a chance to try each role.
 

### B. Run the tests
When you run your prototype on a user, you should do the following things:

1. Read your briefing to the user (approximately 30 seconds). Even if this user tested your paper prototype in studio in the past, they may forget what your project is about. 
2. Present your task. Hand the index card to the user and let them read it. Make sure they understand the task. Ask them to talk out loud as they perform the task.
3. Watch the user perform the task. Take notes from your observations, and try not to giv the user hints. You’re not going to be hovering over real users, so it’s important to understand how the struggle with your UI, no matter how painful it is for you to watch.
4. Try to test with **at least three users** during studio so you can see if everyone understands or struggles with the same parts of your interface.


### C. Debrief
Make a list of observations, choose the 10 most serious problems, rate them, and order them (according to what can be fixed in the next month). Create a separate list of low-hanging fruit (things that are easy to fix).

## Next Week's Submission
In your team's next submission (P7), you will submit:
1.  a written description of the usability problems you discovered from testing. You will screenshots of your computer prototype to illustrate your observations.
2. A summary of what you learned about the parts of your interface from this prototype (from testing last week), and some proposed design solutions to potentially address the usability problems you found.
