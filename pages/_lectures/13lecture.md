One of the most referenced books in Human Computer Interaction is The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman.  While this book talks about everyday objects rather than computer systems, the design approaches discussed in this book are very applicable to the design of interfaces and affordances for web applications.  We'll be talking about the design principles discussed in the first chapter of the book in lecture on Monday.

While reading, consider the following questions:

* What are the design principles that Norman introduces in Chapter 1?
* How might you apply these same principles to the design of web interfaces?
