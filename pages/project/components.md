For your project, you will need to select three components from the lists below to include in your design. You must select at least one component from Group 1 and one from Group 2. Some may be used in combination; for example you may choose to include a Data Visualization (Group 1) and then extend it with an Interactive Data Filter (Group 2). This would count as two components.  If you have any questions about the components, please reach out to the course staff!

## 1. Data Collection Form
A form is used to collect data from users. Forms are ubiquitous on the web; you fill one out every time you purchase something or sign up for an event online. For this project, your form should meet the following requirements at a minimum:
1. Contain at least five fields.
2. Contain at least two different types of fields (text, radio, checkbox, etc.).
3. Support data validation. Data validation functions check to see whether the user entered data into a form correctly. For example, if a particular field asks for the userâ€™s phone number, the user should not be allowed to enter text or an incorrect number of digits. Your data validation functions should be intuitive based on your input fields.
4. Follow the guidelines for good form design (covered in lecture).
