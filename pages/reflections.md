# About the Course Materials
These HCI 330 course materials are based on the work of Mike Horn, Nell O'Rourke, and others. HCI 330 is a 10-week undergraduate course in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University that introduces some principles for designing and analyzing interactive, user-facing computer systems. Topics include user-centered design, prototyping and evaluation techniques, accessibility, and graphical design fundamentals. The course also reviews emerging areas of HCI research. 

As students learn these principles, they also work in teams to design and evaluate a web app, using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Experimental Material (Winter 2020)
This quarter, I had a few experimental learning goals for students -- some relating to the design and analysis of human-computer systems, and some relating to practical/technical skill development. These two sets of learning goals came out of challenges I encountered while teaching the course previously (Winter, 2019), as elaborated below. I didn't formally evaluate any of these lessons, but I can give some qualitative accounts of student work as well, as well as some of their own reflections in a post-course questionnaire that I administered.

## Design Analysis Goals
In terms of analyzing the design of computing technologies, I wanted students to spend a little more time thinking about the social implications of computer-mediated systems, and how a designer's values and assumptions can have serious impacts on the world.

### Goal 1: A recognition that technologies shape individual behavior AND larger social systems
In other words, it's important that technology designers examine how computing technologies cand and do impact on different groups of people -- both intentionally and unintentionally. To support this learning goal, I:
   1. Assigned 2 articles (Winner, 1980 and Morozov, 2013) and discussed them in <a href="https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/02lecture" target="_blank">Lecture 2: Possibilities and Limits</a>.
   2. Created a homework assignment that asked them to analyze the politics of a technology, based on a similar activity assigned by Sepehr Vakil: <a href="https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/assignments/hw3" target="_blank">HW3: Sociopolitical Analysis</a>. I allowed students to resubmit if they really missed the mark on this one, since this was outside of their comfort zones.
   3. Created an <a href="https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/26lecture" target="_blank">Ethics Lecture</a> that considered some of the challenges of computer-mediated systems, and how the very same technologies that bring us so many wonderful things can be just as easily used in antisocial ways.

> **Reflection**: 
> * I found many of the HW3 essays to be fantastic. That said, many of the essays appeared to have taken no more than 20 minutes to write, with no demonstration that they understood the readings.
> * Students were pretty engaged in the class discussion in Lecture 2 (IMO it was one of the better lectures I gave). 
> * I'm pretty sure the Ethics Lecture bored people (radio silence in terms of class participation), but I don't have any metrics on that.
> * When I asked students to rate the value of HW3 (N=33 out of 140), they gave the following feedback, which was pretty disappointing. While of course I do think that the spirit of the assignment is extremely valuable, there is obvious more work to be done in order to make these ideas land with students.

| How valuable did you find HW3? | Count |
|--|--|
| Not Valuable | 7 |
| Neutral | 11 |
| Somewhat Valuable | 11 |
| Very Valuable | 4 |

### Goal 2: Make one's own assumptions explicit
Q: how do you turn assumptions into researchable questions (versus taking your worldview as a given)?

As future technology designers, I also wanted students to really think about how their unexamined beliefs and assumptions might impact their designs. To to this, I asked each team to name some of their implicit assumptions and turn each assumption into hypotheses that they could evaluate via user / internet research. Of course this is a key tenet of design research, but of course identifying one's own assumptions is difficult for us all. To support this, I tried the following:

   1. Deconstructing some of studentsâ€™ individual project proposals in <a href="https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/04lecture" target="_blank">lecture</a>, in order to  pull out the assumptions about the problem space.
   2. In studio, each team was asked to complete a <a href="https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/lectures/09lab" target="_blank">user research prep worksheet</a>
   3. Elevating the process (not just the artifact)<br>I wanted them to spend some time reflecting on the process of devising an app, and the rationale behind their design choices and iterations.

> **Reflection**
> * I think the design worksheet worked pretty well, and I did see students thinking about what they wanted to learn from user research, and some thoughtful reflections on what they learned from contextual inquiries and interviews. Some students, on the other hand, skipped interviews / CI altogether and did surveys. WHY!?
> * While I think that the group presentation also achieves this, we didn't get to do presentations b/c of COVID-19, so the report
