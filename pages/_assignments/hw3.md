## Instructions
For this assignment, you will pick a computer-mediated website or app and deconstruct it. Using the Winner article, the Morozov interview, or both, conduct a sociopolitical analysis of your technology. Your paper should address at least 4 of the questions listed below: 

1. What are the politics behind this technology? 
2. Who is affected by its design? 
3. Who wins and who loses as a result of its creation and use?
4. How, specifically, does the technology shape who wins and who loses?
5. Is this app / phenomenon a fad? That is, in 10 years, do you think this technology will exist? 
6. Is this app inherently political or does it imbue a "form of order"?

Here are some applications that could be interesting to deconstruct, but feel free to explore and think broadly about the app you want to analyze.
