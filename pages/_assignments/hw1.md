Your first studio (on Thursday/Friday) will focus on brainstorming ideas for the quarter-long project. In this assignment, you will develop three project ideas to help jump-start the brainstorming activity in section. 

## Project Ideas

For each project idea, list the domain, goal, and obstacle. For example:

### Project Idea 1
* Domain: wellness
* Goal: help people get enough sleep every night
* Obstacle: people get woken up by text messages, disrupting their sleep

### Project Idea 2
* Domain: sustainability
* Goal: help people save electricity to help the environment
* Obstacle: people forget to turn off the lights, making it hard to save electricity

### Project Idea 3
* Domain: wellness
* Goal: help people reduce their social media use
* Obstacle: notifications make people want to check social media, encouraging use

## Requirements
1. At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains listed above. You other two ideas should be from domains not in this list, in order to broaden the brainstorming activity. 
2. Ensure the ideas are significantly different, not small variations on the same idea. Be sure to focus on goals and obstacles, not potential design solutions. Your idea should not mention any technology at this stage.
3. Most importantly, be creative! The example ideas presented here are intentionally boring for clarity; think outside the box and come up with problems you'd be excited to spend the quarter studying.

## What to Submit
Your submission should be no more than one page of text in PDF format. Make sure your name and section are listed at the top of your submission.
