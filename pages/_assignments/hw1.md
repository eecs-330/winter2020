Your first studio (on Thursday/Friday) will focus on brainstorming ideas for the quarter-long project. In this assignment, you will develop three project ideas to help jump-start the brainstorming activity in section. 

## Project Ideas

For each project idea, list the domain, goal, and obstacle. For example:

### Project Idea 1
* Domain: friendship and family
* Goal: help people stay in touch with one another over distance
* Obstacle: feeling too busy, not having the energy, coordinating schedules

### Project Idea 2
* Domain: sustainability
* Goal: help people save electricity to help the environment
* Obstacle: people forget to turn off the lights, making it hard to save electricity

### Project Idea 3
* Domain: volunteering
* Goal: help connect people with rewarding volunteering experiences
* Obstacle: not knowing where to begin, wanting to meet others who are interested

## Requirements
Really, this is a chance to think about what kinds of problems, goals, and situations that you care about and want to explore. Computing applications can be brought to bear on all sorts of different situations. Feel free to think broadly about problems and applications. During studio, you're going to have the opportunity to both share your ideas and listen to the ideas of others.

## Submission Checklist
Your submission should be no more than one page of text in PDF format. Make sure your name and section are listed at the top of your submission.
