As a final reflection on group work, please allocate 100 "contribution/effort" points across your teammates. In other words, how would you rate each person on your team's relative contribution to the project across the 10 weeks. For instance, if I worked with Larry, Moe, Curly, and Sue, and I felt that everyone contributed equally, I would enter the following into the textbox:

{:.small}
| Name | Points |
|--|--|
| Me | 20 |
| Larry | 20 |
| Moe | 20 |
| Curly | 20 |
| Sue | 20 |

However, If I felt like Larry and Curly contributed disproportionately less, I might enter something like:

{:.small}
| Name | Points |
|--|--|
| Me | 23.3 |
| Larry | 23.3 |
| Moe | 23.3 |
| Curly | 15 |
| Sue | 15|

This will not impact anyone's score unless there are extreme differentials across participation and a student's grade is already borderline. The purpose of this is to ensure some level of accountability for individual contributions to the team. This submission will only be seen by the graders (not your teammates) and will be treated as confidential by the course staff. You are welcome to also add any additional comments and context as you see fit.
