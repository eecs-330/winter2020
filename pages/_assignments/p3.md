## Instructions
In this assignment you will build on what you learned during needfinding in P2 to identify a set of scenarios that describe what goals your users need to be able to accomplish by interacting with your system. Then, you will identify a set of core tasks that your system must include to effectively support these task scenarios. Finally, you will identify three features that you will include in your design.

 

What to Hand In:

A PDF document that includes the following sections:

### Scenarios
Write three to five scenarios that describe representative users and what they should be able to accomplish with your system. You will implement features to support these task scenarios by the end of the quarter. Each scenario should state who the user is (especially if you have multiple classes of users). Each scenario should describe the user's goal, and the steps they need to accomplish to reach that goal, but should not explain how they would do it in your app (do not talk about the solution yet). Scenarios may include multiple chains of interactions. The number of task scenarios you chose will be dependent on your project; some projects may include many simple tasks while others may include a smaller number of more complex tasks. 

### Tasks
Describe the tasks that your system will need to support these scenarios. Break your tasks into two categories: 
1. **essential tasks**: Ones that must be supported to meet your users' needs. These are tasks that you will definitely need to implement by the end of the quarter. 
2. **nice-to-haves**: Ones that could allow your system to more effectively support your users' needs, for example by increasing efficiency or making the user experience more enjoyable. 

Each tasks should describe an interaction or action that your system should support, but should not mention specific features yet. Remember Norman's Paradox of Technology: supporting too many features can make a system unusable, so think carefully about your project scope and choose wisely.

### Features
After defining your representative tasks and features, select three features that your solution will include. For each feature, describe why you chose it and how it will help you support your tasks. If a feature is not needed to support one or more of your essential tasks, it's probably not the right fit. Be thoughtful and select features that make sense given the tasks you want to support.

## Submission Checklist
1. **Scenarios**: Report describes 3-5 scenarios which are rooted in team's user research. Scenarios state who the users are and what they to accomplish.
2. **Tasks**: Report describes "essential" and "nice-to-have" tasks to support. All of the "essential" tasks are motivated by at least one of the scenarios.
3. **Features**: Report describes 3 features that the team intends to implement. These features are tied to the tasks identified from the task list.
