### OPTION 1: Instantiating Principled Composition via CSS
CSS is unweildy, but if you're going to be a designer within the web medium, you have to learn it. For this extra credit option, please do the following:

#### Your Task

{:.spaced}
1. Open the following <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/vYOGbmL?editors=1000" target="_blank">Codepen</a>. You can either fork it and register for CodePen to save it, or download the files and edit them using a code editor.
2. Select a header and a body copy font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. Here is some <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/gOpryzO?editors=0100" target="_blank">sample code</a> of how this is done.
3. Instantiate the principles of **proximity** and **alignment** to create nice photo cards that flow. Consider using flexbox (see <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/EJQwej?editors=0100" target="_blank">this sample</a>).
4. Modify the HTML / CSS so that there is one featured photo. Use the principle of **contrast** to make it stand out.
5. When you're done, paste a link to your file (ideally on CodePen) in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fA4H-EnNbrQYhrsWHYniG6vUECCbwXsSmd2cgKitb_0/edit" target="_blank">this Google Doc</a> so that we can take a look at different techniques. You will continue working on this next week, so make sure you keep track of your files.

> #### Tips 
> * Use whitespace liberally.
> * Play around with different font weights (and choose a font that supports many weights).
> * Try not to use any borders. Let the whitespace shape the sections.
> * See [Lecture 12: Visual Design Part I](../lectures/19lecture) for more details

### OPTION 2: Style Tiles (Branding)


#### Your Task

{:.spaced}

1. Select three values from the [list of values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv5tPZ8UjqJNYO9pCp_PQhxHT8qoGY09deKX6uygUFA/edit?usp=sharing) page.
Page of Values
2. Create two different style tile concepts using this <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/rNVjYBd?editors=1000" target="_blank">style tile template</a> on CodePen (and feel free to make any changes to it).
3. Submit your 2 style tiles and write a 1-page summary of how your style tiles communicate your projectâ€™s values.
